# Project Organization

## Crate layout

Every crate follows the same structure:

```
crates/<name>/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs              # Module declarations, re-exports, main struct
    ├── model/              # Data definitions (types, enums, structs)
    │   ├── mod.rs
    │   ├── declarations.rs
    │   ├── expression.rs
    │   └── ...
    ├── modules/            # (optional) Stateful registries
    │   ├── mod.rs
    │   ├── types.rs
    │   └── scopes.rs
    ├── helpers/            # (optional) Simple utility functions
    │   ├── mod.rs
    │   ├── types.rs
    │   └── ...
    └── *.rs                 # Implementation files (flat, no subdirectory)
```

### Rules

1. **`model/`** — Pure data structures only. `#[derive(Debug)]` enums and structs
   with constructors but minimal logic. Model types know nothing about how they
   are built.

2. **`*.rs` at crate root** — All implementation logic lives in flat files
   directly under `src/`. No `implementation/`, `helper/`, or similar
   subdirectories for logic.

3. **`lib.rs`** — Declares all submodules and re-exports public types. The
   crate's main struct is defined here alongside its top-level orchestration
   method (e.g. `generate()`, `check()`). Keep `lib.rs` focused — if the
   orchestration logic grows beyond ~50 lines, move it to its own file
   (e.g. `src/generate.rs`).

4. Each implementation file is an `impl` block on the crate's main struct,
   grouped by concern:
   - `src/declarations.rs` → `impl SlynxHir { fn hoist_stylesheet ... }`
   - `src/expression.rs` → `impl SlynxHir { fn resolve_expr ... }`

5. **`error.rs`** — Every crate that defines error types puts them in
   `src/error.rs`. The type is named `<Crate>Error` (e.g. `HIRError`,
   `TypeError`, `IRError`).

6. **`helpers/`** — Only for simple, stateless utility functions. The kind of
   thing that could be a free function. Examples:
   - `helpers/types.rs` — `int32_type()`, `float32_type()` — one-liner accessors
   - `helpers/names.rs` — `intern_name()`, `retrieve_symbol()` — basic lookups

   Helpers must NOT contain complex lowering, transformation, or analysis
   logic. If a function is more than ~10 lines or calls into model/structural
   code, it belongs in `src/*.rs` as part of the main `impl` block, not in
   `helpers/`.

7. **`modules/`** — Only for stateful registries that accumulate data across
   the entire compilation of a crate. These are long-lived stores (type
   registries, scope stacks, declaration tables). Not for logic.

---

## Helper definition

A helper is a function that:

- Is **simple** (typically 1-5 lines, never more than ~10)
- Is **stateless** (pure lookup, no mutations beyond the registry itself)
- Does **one basic thing** (get a type, intern a name, retrieve a field)

Helper functions are defined on the crate's main struct but grouped in
`src/helpers/` instead of inline to keep the main implementation files
uncluttered. They are typically:

```rust
// helpers/types.rs
impl SlynxHir {
    pub fn int32_type(&self) -> TypeId {
        self.modules.types_module.int_id()
    }
    pub fn float32_type(&self) -> TypeId {
        self.modules.types_module.float_id()
    }
}
```

If a function does any of the following, it does NOT belong in helpers:
- Iterates over declarations or expressions
- Transforms or lowers one representation into another
- Contains match arms on more than 2 variants
- Calls into the checker or IR generator

These belong in the appropriate `src/*.rs` implementation file.

Each crate consumes the previous one's output and produces input for the next.
No crate imports a later stage. `common` is shared by all.

## Per-crate breakdown

### `crates/lexer`

```
src/
├── lib.rs         # Lexer struct + tokenize()
├── tokens.rs      # Token, TokenKind
└── error.rs       # LexerError
```

Flat — no model/ directory needed (types are simple enough to live alongside logic).

### `crates/parser`

```
src/
├── lib.rs              # Parser struct + parse_declarations()
├── ast/                # AST data definitions

src/
└── lib.rs         # Monomorphizer struct + resolve()
```

### `crates/slynx_ir`

## Patterns per role

| Role | Where it lives | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Data types | `src/model/*.rs` | `HirDeclaration`, `StyleProperty`, `Instruction` |
| Main struct | `src/lib.rs` | `SlynxHir`, `TypeChecker`, `SlynxIR` |
| Orchestration | `src/lib.rs` (or `src/generate.rs` if large) | `generate()`, `check()` |
| Phase 1 logic | `src/<name>.rs` | `hoist_stylesheet()`, `resolve_specialized()` |
| Phase 2 logic | `src/<name>.rs` | `default_stylesheet()`, `lower_stylesheet()` |
| Error types | `src/error.rs` | `HIRError`, `TypeError`, `IRError` |
| ID types | `src/id.rs` | `DeclarationId`, `TypeId` |
| Registries | `src/modules/*.rs` | `TypesModule`, `ScopeModule` |
| Simple utilities | `src/helpers/*.rs` | `int32_type()`, `float32_type()` |

## Naming conventions

See [`name-convention.md`](name-convention.md) for the naming conventions used
across phases.

---

## Status vs. the target pattern

| Crate | Follows pattern? | Issues |
|---|---|---|
| common | ✅ | — |
| lexer | ✅ | — |
| parser | ✅ | — |
| hir | ⚠️ | `implementation/` folder — logic should be in `src/*.rs` |
| checker | ✅ | — |
| monomorphizer | ✅ | (single file is fine) |
| slynx_ir | ❌ | `ir/model/` should be `src/model/`. `ir/helper/` should be flat `src/*.rs`. The `ir/` wrapper directory is redundant because the crate is already `slynx_ir`. |

---

## Rust project organization assessment

The project generally follows standard Rust conventions but has several areas
that deviate from idiomatic practice:

### What follows convention ✅

- **Workspace layout**: Each major subsystem is a separate crate with its own
  `Cargo.toml`. This is the standard approach for multi-crate Rust projects.
- **`lib.rs` as crate root**: Each crate exposes its public API through
  `lib.rs`. Correct.
- **Error types in dedicated `error.rs`**: Consistent across all crates. Good.
- **File-per-concept naming**: Files are named after their primary type
  (`lexer.rs`, `parser.rs`, `expression.rs`). This is the standard convention.
- **`tests/` directory at workspace root**: Integration tests live in the
  top-level `tests/` directory. Standard.

### What could be improved ⚠️

#### 1. `slynx_ir` has redundant nesting

```
src/ir/model/       → should be  src/model/
src/ir/helper/      → should be  src/*.rs (flat)
src/ir/components.rs → should be  src/components.rs
```

The crate is named `slynx_ir`. Having an `ir/` subdirectory inside it is
redundant — the entire crate IS the IR. Every file is already "IR" code.
This adds 1-2 unnecessary directory levels to every import path.

**Fix**: Flatten `ir/model/` → `model/`, `ir/helper/` → `*.rs`,
`ir/*.rs` → `src/*.rs`. Remove the `ir/` wrapper.

#### 2. `lib.rs` in checker and HIR is too large

Checker's `lib.rs` is 423 lines and contains the `TypeChecker` struct,
the top-level `check()` orchestration, AND the entire unification engine
(`unify()`, `unify_with_ref()`, `recursive_ty()`).

HIR's `lib.rs` is 445 lines and contains the `SlynxHir` struct AND the
entire `generate()` two-pass orchestration.

Standard Rust convention is for `lib.rs` to be lean module declarations
and re-exports, with logic in named files.

**Fix**: Move unification from checker's `lib.rs` to `src/unify.rs`.
Move HIR's `generate()` body to `src/generate.rs`.

#### 3. `slynx_ir/src/ir/model/` + `slynx_ir/src/types/` — two type systems

The IR crate has two directories defining types:
- `src/ir/model/` — IR instruction model (Context, Label, Value, Instruction, StyleProperty)
- `src/types/` — The IR type system (IRType, IRTypes, structs, functions, components)

These serve different purposes, but having both at different nesting levels
is confusing. They should either be merged into `src/model/` or both live
at the same level with clear names.

#### 5. `helpers/` in HIR is inconsistently used

`helpers/expressions.rs`, `helpers/names.rs`, and `helpers/types.rs` contain
one-liner accessors. This is correct per the helper definition above. However,
`helpers/names.rs` also contains `retrieve_information_of_type()` which is
~15 lines and does non-trivial lookup logic — this should arguably be in
`src/names.rs` alongside the other name resolution functions.

#### 6. Inline tests are sparse

Rust convention is to include `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` at the bottom
of implementation files. Most files in this project lack inline tests, relying
instead on integration tests in the top-level `tests/` directory. While
integration tests are valuable, unit tests inline would improve coverage and
document edge cases.

### Summary of recommended changes

| Change | Crate | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Flatten `ir/` → remove wrapper | slynx_ir | 1hr |
| Move `ir/helper/` logic to flat `*.rs` | slynx_ir | 30min |
| Move `unify()` to `src/unify.rs` | checker | 15min |
| Move `generate()` body to `src/generate.rs` | hir | 15min |
| Add `pub use` re-exports to lib.rs | all | 10min each |
| Add inline unit tests | all | ongoing |

#### 7. Name Conventions

The name conventions on this project are intended to determine how a function should be named so it is easier to navigate and find functions.
The convention SHOULD be implemented in every phase, except by parser phase, which is intended mainly for parsing, thus, is not included due to not saving nor managing much data.

'generate_*' -> A function that takes an input, and returns an output. Such as generating an Hir Function from a Function declaration from AST
'get_*' -> Retrieves some information that was previously generated
'create_*' -> A function that takes one or more input, and returns an output. The difference to `generate`is that the inputs are not bound to a phase specifically. So it can be 'create_add_expression' and not 'generate', because 'generate' would require something specific from a phase, in that case, a binary expression. So a 'generate_expression' function might be able to call 'create_add_expression'

Internal functions that ARE NOT exposed are not required to follow this, since they're auxiliary functions, but yet should follow a pattern, which by now wont be determined
