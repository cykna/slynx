//! High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR)
//!
//! The HIR (High-Level Intermediate Representation) module is responsible for transforming
//! the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a more semantically rich representation that preserves
//! the original code's meaning while preparing it for type analysis and code generation.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The HIR serves as a bridge between the syntactic representation (AST) and lower-level
//! representations (MIR, IR). It provides:
//! - Rich type information with explicit type relationships
//! - Scoped variable and declaration tracking
//! - Structured representation of components, functions, and objects
//! - Type inference support through `HirType::Infer`
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The module is organized into several submodules, each with distinct responsibilities:
//!
//! - **[`model`]** — Data structures representing HIR elements (declarations, expressions, types)
//! - **[`implementation`]** — Logic for transforming AST into HIR
//! - **[`modules`]** — Management of scopes, symbols, types, and declarations
//! - **[`helpers`]** — Utility functions for constructing HIR elements
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::hir::SlynxHir;
//! use common::ast::ASTDeclaration;
//!
//! // Create a new HIR instance
//! let mut hir = SlynxHir::new();
//!
//! // Transform AST declarations into HIR
//! let ast: Vec<ASTDeclaration> = /* parsed AST */;
//! hir.generate(ast)?;
//!
//! // Access the resulting HIR
//! for decl in &hir.declarations {
//!     match &decl.kind {
//!         hir::model::HirDeclarationKind::Function { name, .. } => {
//!             println!("Function: {}", hir.names.symbol_name(name));
//!         }
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Type System
//!
//! The HIR uses a rich type system represented by [`HirType`] that includes:
//! - Primitive types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `void`
//! - Composite types: `struct`, `tuple`, `function`, `component`
//! - Reference types with generics
//! - Special types: `infer` for type inference
//!
//! See [`model::types::HirType`] for complete type documentation.
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! HIR operations return [`Result<T, HIRError>`] where [`HIRError`] provides detailed
//! diagnostic information including source spans and error kinds.
//!
//! Common errors include:
//! - [`HIRErrorKind::NameNotRecognized`] — Undefined identifier
//! - [`HIRErrorKind::PropertyNotRecognized`] — Invalid field access
//! - [`HIRErrorKind::NotAFunction`] — Call of non-function value
//! - [`HIRErrorKind::MissingProperty`] — Missing required object fields

/// `SlynxHir` manages the transformation of AST declarations into a complete HIR

///
/// # Structure
///
/// The HIR is built through a two-phase process:
///
/// 1. **Hoisting Phase** — Top-level declarations (functions, components, objects)
///    are registered in their respective scopes before their bodies are resolved.
///    This ensures forward references are valid (e.g., calling a function defined
///    later in the source).
///
/// 2. **Resolution Phase** — The bodies of functions and components are processed,
///    expressions are typed, and variable references are resolved to their
///    declarations.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - [`modules`](SlynxHir::modules) — Manages scopes, symbols, types, and declarations
/// - [`declarations`](SlynxHir::declarations) — All top-level declarations in the HIR
/// - `types` — Internal cache mapping type IDs to their [`HirType`] representations
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use slynx_frontend::hir::{SlynxHir, Result};
/// # use common::ast::{ASTDeclaration, ASTDeclarationKind, GenericIdentifier, Span};
/// # fn example() -> Result<()> {
/// let mut hir = SlynxHir::new();
///
/// // The HIR is populated by generating from AST
/// let ast: Vec<ASTDeclaration> = vec![
///     // Your parsed declarations here
/// ];
///
/// hir.generate(ast)?;
///
/// // Now hir.declarations contains the full HIR
/// assert!(!hir.declarations.is_empty());
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```

    /// - Components have their property layouts established
    /// - Objects declare their field structure
    /// - Type aliases create name → type mappings
    ///
    /// ## Phase 2: Resolution
    ///
    /// The bodies of declarations are processed to:
    /// - Type-check expressions and statements
    /// - Resolve variable and function references
    /// - Validate field accesses and method calls
    /// - Build the complete HIR representation

    ///
    /// * [`Ok(())`] — HIR generation succeeded
    /// * [`Err(HIRError)`] — A semantic error was encountered
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// This function can return various [`HIRError`] kinds, including:
    ///
    /// - [`NameNotRecognized`] — Reference to undefined identifier
    /// - [`PropertyNotRecognized`] — Invalid field access on object/component
    /// - [`NotAFunction`] — Attempt to call a non-function value
    /// - [`MissingProperty`] — Required object field not provided
    /// - [`RecursiveType`] — Illegal recursive type definition
    ///

    /// let mut hir = SlynxHir::new();
    /// hir.generate(source)?;

    /// 1. First pass (hoisting): Calls [`hoist`](SlynxHir::hoist) on each declaration
    ///    to register it without resolving its body
    ///

    ///    declaration to process its full body and build HIR nodes

    /// references to them are resolved, supporting mutual recursion.
