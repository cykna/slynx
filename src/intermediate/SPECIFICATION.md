# Slynx IR

Slynx IR specifies what the backend compiling it should do instead of how, even though the language is a bit opiniously about how to do so.
First of all the IR follows SSA and is extremely typed.
The IR has got the concept of 'contexts' that are anything able to be runned, this means a struct isn't a context, because it by itself cannot execute code, but a method or a function are, as well as components that can have code
to be run, such as the reactivity their reactivity model.

## Syntax

### Basic Types

Primitive scalar types used by this IR:

* Signed integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
* Unsigned integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`
* Floating point: `f32`, `f64`
* Boolean: `bool`
* Pointer-sized unsigned integer: `usize`, `isize`

`usize` means target-native pointer-sized unsigned integer when the backend supports it.
If a backend has no native `usize` representation, it must treat `usize` as `u64`.
The same idea is used for `isize`, if the backend has no isize representation, then it's represented as a `i64`

Text and byte-oriented primitive types:

* `str`: immutable UTF-8 string handle type
* `bytes`: immutable byte-sequence handle type

Language-level aliases currently used in examples:

* `int` maps to an integer primitive selected by the frontend/lowering stage which is idealized to be i32
* `float` maps to a floating primitive selected by the frontend/lowering stage which is idealized to be f32


### Structs
The IR has implementation of operations primitives. The syntax for the deffinition of a struct can be the following:

`struct %S {int, float};`

Which represents the following struct:

```
object S {
  property_1: int,
  property_2: float
}
```

Tuples(WIP) use the same method, so a tuple in slynx denotated by
```slynx

object T(int,float);

```

is defined by the same way as `S`, the only thing is how their fields are accessed on the code. (Tuples must be implemented in slynx yet)

#### Functions
Functions are defined on the IR level as the following:
```
int #add(int, int) {
  result = addi32 p0, p1;
  ret result;
}
```
Where p0 is the first parameter and p1 the second one. The order of the names then is pN where N is the (N+1)th parameter of the function.
Something in slynx such as
```slynx
struct Currency {
  money: int
}

func currency_of(money: int): Currency {
  Currency(money: money)
}
```
in the IR can be represented by

```

struct %Currency {int}

%Currency currency_of(int) {
  result = %Currency{0};
  propset result, 0, p0;
  ret result;
}

```

Which represents that it creates a temporary variable named `result` being the currency zeroed. storefield stores the value of `p0` on the first field of `result`

#### Strings
Strings on the IR are represented as internalized values. On the IR they live on a separated struct called Internalizer, and their access can be made via slices. Note that this IR expects them to be UTF8, and be represented as, inside the IR

```
struct %Handle {usize, usize}
```
which in slynx would be

```slynx
struct Handle {
  ptr: usize,
  length: usize, //length in bytes
}
```

Note that this is a internal struct that is automatically put on the IR.
When referencing a string, what the IR will see it's the string logical pointer, so the specialized backend only sees it as well, and based on this pointer, the compiler can access the string on the Internalizer.
Strings or `str` type in slynx, are supposed to be utf8 and immutable. Due to that, on the IR textual form, the way of seeing the usage of a string is via %StrHandle.

Suppose the following:
```slynx
object Person {
  name: str,
  age: int
}
func main(): Person{
  let p = Person(name: "jorge", age: 44);
  p
}
```

on the IR it would be represented as
```
struct %StrHandle {usize, usize}
@str0 = "jorge"; //this is a handle to the string "jorge", but its just for readability, because internally its the %StrHandle

struct %Person {%StrHandle, i32}

%Person main(void) {
  p = %Person{@str0, 44};
  ret p;
}
```

and so the compiler can determine how it should be done internally.<br>
The instructions for strings are:



#### Components

Since components in Slynx are a bit more complex than a simple struct, as they can execute some sort of code during runtime, they can be declared as contexts as well. This said, the implementation of the reactivity may be specific from one compiler to another
even though slynx in its PoC is idealized(might change since its not complete yet) to be OOP like.
A component like the following:

```slynx

func f(n: int): int {
  n * 2
}

component Counter {
  pub prop count = 0;
  Text {
    text: count
  }
  Text {
    text: f(count)
  }
}

func main():Component {
  Counter {}
  Counter {count: 12}
}
```

Can be compiled to an IR that looks like the following:

```

int f(int) {
  result = muli32 p0, 2;
  ret result;
}

component %Counter(int) {
  %count: int = p0;
  #t0: specialized Text;
  #t1: specialized Text;
  @bind %count -> field #t0, 0;
  @bind %count |> f -> field #t1, 0;
}

AnyComponent main() {
  Counter0 = %Counter(0); //0 = default value
  Counter1 = %Counter(12);
  ret Counter1
}

```
The idea is that instead of the value being optional on the IR as it's on the Slynx code, is to when the value is ommited, we instead of passing null, pass the explictly the default value.
For some button that updates the state, suppose the following code:

```slynx

func f(n: int): int {
  n * 2
}

component Counter {
  pub prop count = 0;
  Text {
    text: count
  }
  Text {
    text: f(count)
  }
  Button {
    on_click: _ -> count += 1
  }
}

func main():Component {
  Counter {}
  Counter {count: 12}
}

```
which will generate:

```

special component %Text(bytes) {
  %text: bytes = p0;
}

int f(int) {
  result = muli32 p0, 2;
  ret result;
}

void Counter_count_update(%Counter) {
  count = prop_get p0, 0;
  inc = addi32 count, 1;
  prop_set p0, 0, inc;
  @emit p0, %count;
  @rerender p0;
}

component %Counter(int) {
  %count: int = p0;

  #t0: specialized Text;
  #t1: specialized Text;
  #b1: specialized Button;

  #b1.click -> Counter_count_update(self)

  @bind %count -> field #t0, 0;
  @bind %count |> f -> field #t1, 0;
  
}

AnyComponent main() {
  Counter0 = %Counter(0); //0 = default value
  Counter1 = %Counter(12);
  ret Counter;
}

```

Differently of default values, special values are primitives that are expected to exist on the runtime we are compiling to.

### Binds

On Components, @binds are way to determine which value on the component should update which dependency. On the %Counter example above, we had
```
@bind %count -> field #t0, 0;
@bind %count |> f -> field #t1, 0;
```

which means that, on %count update, it updates with the new value, the value of the field 0 of #t0. For the field 0 of #t1, it updates it using `%count |> f`, which means that the value of `call f, %count`, is used as the new value.
The `@emit p0, %count` on the function, tells that `p0` should execute its `%count` binds. And after executing them, send a re-render with @rerender.

#### Instructions

##### Integer Operations

For now, arithmetic instructions are only defined for integer types.
Each instruction takes two operands of the same type and returns a value of that same type.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, arithmetic instructions in this section are saturating.

Saturating semantics:

* If the exact result is representable in the operand type, that result is returned.
* If the exact result is above the type maximum, the type maximum is returned.
* If the exact result is below the type minimum, the type minimum is returned.
* For division, divide-by-zero traps. Signed `MIN / -1` saturates to `MAX`.

Addition:

* addi8: saturating add of two `i8` values, returns an `i8`

##### Floating Point Operations

Floating point instructions follow IEEE-754 semantics and are not saturating.
Backends must preserve NaN, infinity and signed zero behavior.
Unless a backend cannot represent a specific edge case, the default rounding mode is round-to-nearest, ties-to-even.
Floating point divide-by-zero does not trap and follows IEEE-754 results.

* addf32: adds two `f32` values and returns an `f32`
* addf64: adds two `f64` values and returns an `f64`

Subtraction:

* subf32: subtracts the second `f32` from the first and returns an `f32`
* subf64: subtracts the second `f64` from the first and returns an `f64`

Multiplication:

* mulf32: multiplies two `f32` values and returns an `f32`
* mulf64: multiplies two `f64` values and returns an `f64`

Division:

* divf32: divides the first `f32` by the second and returns an `f32`
* divf64: divides the first `f64` by the second and returns an `f64`
